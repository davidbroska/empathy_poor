You say empathy? I say the systems are fucking BROKEN. I still help homeless people whenever I can. No, homeless shelters are designed so people can't get out. Without homeless people, those people are out of the job. 

I struggled so hard to get out of homelessness because OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE BRING YOU THE FUCK DOWN. A dollar here, a quarter there. I totally felt for that broad who had a job because I literally made my entire day around work and showering. 

Literally up at 5:30 am because that's when the shelter woke us up, charge my phone and laptop if I could. Get on the bus at 7:30, go to work for 9. Work til 5, get the 530 bus, rush down to the showering shelter (I was in overflow) sign up, wait for a shower. It was fucking BEAT. Getting an apartment to even give me a chances was FUCKING BEAT. Struggling for 1st months and last months. FUCKING BEAT. Dealing with crazies and drug addicts and ""friends"" was fucking BEAT. 

I was used to being homeless. Used to giving away all my money daily. I worked on mturk as a drifter, sleeping outside, helping ""normal"" homeless people get jobs, get government assistance, all that bullshit. 

Covid got me inside. I work FULL TIME on mturk due to losing my job in Reno due to getting sick. I had a pneumonia, 2 week quarantine, no job for me anymore when it was over. I work on mturk 12-14 hours a day now. I state my business. I get paid shit vs effort and time. 2.15 for a 20-30 minute survey.

I have no sympathy for panhandlers though. If they invest the money (save it) they can be off the streets in 2 weeks... but 100% of the panhandlers I've met have some sort of addiction. No, not 99.9. 100. It's either meth, booze, or gambling. Or whatever addiction you might think of. They might blow it on a night in a motel, but that's only temporary. The general consensuses is I need about... probably 1400 dollars for the 1st and last month, plus a deposit, plus whatever other BS is needed by said apartment complex

So they give up, say fuck it when they get a big amount of cash. Try opening a bank account with no ID  or address. hell, so many doors close when you're homeless. So many things to spend money on, good food at a restaurant, but mainly, it's the hotel motels. 

I was having a good life helping homeless people, even the ""bad"" ones, but my eyes are wide fucking open. Always have been. Only person you can really rely on is yourself. I g2g. This is going to expire otherwise.",AD1ILDUXZHASF,,,EN,1574,,,rep,low,treatment,homeless_3,homeless_1,1

So if we're still seeing this problem then perhaps throwing money at government programs is not the answer. As for limited opportunities for people to better themselves in America, all one needs to do is look at the first and second generation immigrants who have come here (both legally and illegally) to see that there is indeed opportunity. So perhaps the problem is that the people who are born here poor don't want to better themselves for whatever reason. And to add one more thought about throwing more money at the problem, the idea about the $50000 bond is ridiculous because as we've seen this past year all that would happen is that things would end up costing $50000 more.

Once this has become unobtainable and is realized the dream ends. Shelter comes first before a person can effectively perform any type of job duties. Without shelter a whole host of cognitive disorders arise. The employer begins to carry that burden and the worksite / business which in turn becomes a mental health facility instead of a productive profitable business. Half way businesses, half way house,/prison slavery are states of purgatory with no real movement. The scarring effect becomes post traumatic, a latent schizoid disorder that can flare up at anytime. Get people properly house, lower the dissonance and people will work. Recapture the dream by making the possibility of owning land and housing for oneself, self determination equals confidence and high morale which equals moral value and ethical standards. Basic fundamental equations, proper sequencing without the twaddling and nuisances of analogical guessing and maybes.
